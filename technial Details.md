·What are your design considerations?
·How are you going to design, build, and evaluate?
Since we plan to visualize a taxi pickup/dropoff dataset, the visualization must have a map that show the new york city and the edge of each zone. And based on that map, we can add other visualization techniques like scatterplot, piechart etc. to enrich the information that our project shows. 

·What are the technologies you plan to use?
    Visualization techniques: choropleth map, scatter plot, slope graph 
    Tool libs: d3-brush, d3-geoPath, etc.

·How do you plan to use interactive visuals?()
    1. Hover on each zone: Visualize a tip showing the zone name and number of pickups/dropoffs in this zone. 
    2. Scroll: Zoom in/out the map
    3. Drag at the space out of the map but inside the parent element: Move the map within the map element's parent element.
    4. Button: Click to toggle between to/from data for opacity
    5. Drag on zone: Choose start and end zone.

·How does your visualization compare to what others have done? 

·What are the components that make your visualization cool?
    multiple(two here) brushes to enable direct comparison.
